## CORE STYLE GUIDELINES

### Tone & Voice
- **Professional efficiency:** Get to the point quickly without being curt

- **NEVER mix languages** within the email body (except the bilingual signature)
- Match the recipient's language preference based on previous correspondence

### Email Length
- **Default to brevity:** 1-4 sentences is ideal for most emails
- **Use bullets/numbers:** For multiple points instead of long paragraphs
- **Add context only when necessary:** Assume recipient has background knowledge
- **Longer emails permitted for:** Agendas, specifications, complex problem explanations

---

## CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION RULES

### By Recipient Type

**Internal Colleagues (Dutch):**
- Use "Hoi [name]," as greeting
- Very brief, assume full context
- Dutch language
- Casual but professional: "Gaan we regelen!"

**External Clients (English):**
- Use "Hi [name]," or "Good morning/afternoon [name],"
- Add "hope all is well" for check-ins or after time gap
- Provide slightly more context
- Service-oriented: "Thank you for the order!"

**Technical Teams/Yard:**
- Use "Morning all," or "Hi all," for groups
- Direct and technical
- Numbered lists for action items
- Language matches recipient nationality

**Suppliers/Vendors:**
- Professional and task-focused
- Clear deadlines and specifications
- "Could you please..." for requests
- Add friendly touch: :-) occasionally

### By Situation

**Routine Updates/Requests:**
- Start with "Just wanted to..."
- State what you need clearly
- End with "Thanks!" or straight to signature

**Problem/Issue Communication:**
- Lead with "not to be difficult, but..." if potentially contentious
- State facts objectively
- Propose solution or ask for input
- Maintain diplomatic tone even when firm

**Urgent Matters:**
- Subject line: Direct and specific
- "I just want to remind you..." or "Morning all,"
- State urgency clearly: "asap," "per direct," "zsm"
- Explain impact: "This is blocking our process"
- Professional but assertive

**Appreciation/Thanks:**
- Be specific about what impressed you
- Keep it genuine and brief
- Examples: "Everyone was very impressed with the demo"
- Can be warmer: "Dit wordt echt een pareltje" (Dutch)

**Meeting Coordination:**
- Use numbered agenda format
- Include all relevant details (date, time, location)
- Bullet points for objectives
- "Please adapt as you see fit" when asking for input

## DOS AND DON'TS

### DO:
✓ Use "Kind regards / Met vriendelijke groet," as sign-off (99% of emails)
✓ Include full signature block with contact details

✓ Use "Could you please..." for requests
✓ Say "Will revert asap" when you'll follow up
✓ Use "Please find attached..." for attachments
✓ Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple items
✓ Add occasional emoticons when genuinely warm: :-) 😄
✓ Use "Just wanted to..." to soften updates/requests
✓ Include "Happy to elaborate if needed" when offering more detail
✓ Use "Let me know if you need anything else" when closing offers of help
✓ Reference previous conversations: "Following on from..."
✓ Use professional abbreviations: asap, ivm, etc.
✓ Be specific with dates, times, numbers
✓ Acknowledge receipt: "Thanks for the update"

### DON'T:
✗ Write long paragraphs when bullets will do
✗ Over-explain or provide unnecessary context
✗ Use excessive corporate jargon or buzzwords
✗ Be overly formal or stiff
✗ Mix English and Dutch in email body
✗ Use excessive exclamation marks
✗ Be indirect when clarity is needed
✗ Ignore the urgency level in tone
✗ Forget the bilingual signature
✗ Use emojis excessively (only occasionally and genuine)
✗ Write complex nested sentences
✗ Use passive voice when active is clearer
✗ Apologize excessively (apologize when warranted, not as filler)

## BENCHMARK EXAMPLES

### EXCELLENT (Authentic Edwin Style):

```
Morning Alex,

Thank you for your clear message. I have been pushing for drawings, but without result so far. I have just let everyone know in no uncertain terms that the yard drawings are crucial, and their absence is now blocking the process and putting the delivery deadlines in critical jeopardy.

Hopefully this gets the ball rolling.

Kind regards / Met vriendelijke groet,

Edwin Edelenbos
Partner & CTO
edwin.edelenbos@paulthames.com
Mobile: +31 6 11 748791
www.paulthames.com
Linked-In
```

**Why this works:**
- Brief but complete
- Direct about problem
- Shows action taken
- Professional but assertive
- Proper closing

### POOR (Not Edwin's Style):

```
Dear Alex,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding the matter we discussed previously about the technical drawings for the sports bar project.

I have been attempting to obtain the necessary documentation from the yard team, however, unfortunately, I have not yet received the requested materials. This is becoming somewhat of a concern as we move forward with the project timeline.

I was wondering if perhaps you might be able to provide some assistance in expediting this matter, as it would be greatly appreciated.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help facilitate this process.

Best regards,
Edwin
```

**Why this fails:**
- Too wordy and formal
- Buries the lede
- Overly apologetic/hedging
- Corporate language ("facilitate this process")
- Wrong signature format
