description: Find emails you can respond to in under 2 minutes

Find quick-win emails I can clear fast:

**Instructions:**

## Step 1: Gather Context First

1. **Fetch recent sent emails** (`from:me newer_than:3d`)
   - Essential to exclude emails I've already replied to

## Step 2: Find Candidates

2. **Scan unread/recent emails** (last 7 days):
   - Simple confirmations: "Can you confirm...?"
   - Yes/No questions
   - Quick status updates: "What's the status on...?"
   - Schedule confirmations
   - Simple requests: "Can you send...?"
   - Thank you responses / acknowledgments

## Step 3: Verify and Filter

3. **CRITICAL: Verify each email still needs response:**
   - Check if I've already replied to this thread
   - Check if the thread continued after this message
   - Only include emails I have NOT responded to

4. **Exclude complex items:**
   - Requires research or file review
   - Needs input from others
   - Technical specs or detailed explanation
   - Financial/contractual decisions

## Step 4: Draft and Present

5. **Draft responses:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Use `email-helpers/edwin-email-style-guide.md`
   - Ultra-brief (my style!)
   - Correct language per recipient
   - Bilingual signature

6. **Create drafts:**
   - Use `mcp__gmail__create_draft` for each
   - Show drafts for quick review

**Output format:**

```
